# My Gratitude Journal

I wanted to create a gratitude journal that I could make my homepage.
It needs to contain no ads, no links to social media feeds, no content from anywhere else other than what I enter.

This will allow me to start a browsing session off mindfully. With purpose. Rather than just jumping straight into a feed & getting lost.
